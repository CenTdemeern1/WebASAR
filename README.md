# WebASAR
###### Lazy name, I know.

You can find normal ASAR [here](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar), if you were looking for that instead.

# *What it is:*

1. A webserver (http) that integrates with the ASAR assembler.
2. Written in Python 3
3. A fork of a framework I'm working on, most features have been taken out though, it doesn't need them
4. Janky
5. Open-source

# *What it isn't:*
1. Finished
2. Fast
3. A javascript port
4. A full ASAR distribution (it only patches atm)
5. A replacement for your default ASAR

# *Shounds bearable, how do I run it?*
1. Download python 3.7 or higher (preferrably 3.7, that's what it's made for).
2. Run `__main__.py`.
3. Open your browser of choice.
4. Make sure the server stated `server start` otherwise, wait. (it's not going to take long, it's probably done by now)
5. Navigate in your browser to `localhost`. (yes, that's it, you don't need to give it a port.)
6. You're done!
